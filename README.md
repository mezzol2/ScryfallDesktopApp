# ScryfallDesktopApp
This application accesses the Scryfall API via a desktop environment.  This is a student project.


The goals of this project are to help me learn about API integration and to let me explore GUI implementation in a desktop in environment.

The code is written in Java because it allows for use on a broad range of machines, and it is the language I am most familiar with.
